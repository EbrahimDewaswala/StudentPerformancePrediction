# üéì Student Grades Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning classification models to predict and analyze the factors that influence student grades. Using a dataset with diverse student information such as nationality, grade level, number of hands raised in class, attendance, and study hours, the project aims to determine which variables are most impactful on academic performance.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file containing various features related to student performance. These can be grouped into the following broad categories:

* **Demographics:**
  `gender`, `NationalITy`, `PlaceofBirth`

* **Academic Level:**
  `StageID` (e.g., Lower or Upper school), `GradeID`, `SectionID`, `Topic`, `Semester`

* **Parental & Home Factors:**
  `Relation` (relation to parent), `ParentAnsweringSurvey`, `ParentschoolSatisfaction`

* **Student Engagement & Behavior:**
  `raisedhands`, `VisITedResources`, `AnnouncementsView`, `Discussion`, `StudentAbsenceDays`

* **Target Variable:**
  `Class` (final classification of student performance)

```

### ü§ñ Predictions from Models:

```
Using Decision Tree Classifier:             M  
Using Random Forest Classifier:             M
